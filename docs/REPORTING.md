# Periodic public reporting

`perf-sentinel disclose` produces a single JSON document that aggregates findings collected over a calendar period (typically a quarter) into a form suitable for public transparency. The output is hash-verifiable, schema-versioned, and distinct from the per-batch `Report` JSON consumed by the HTML dashboard.

The subcommand is added in v0.6.x and supersedes earlier ad-hoc disclosure recipes.

## When to use which intent

| intent      | validation       | publishable | typical use                     |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| `internal`  | none             | no          | development drafts, dry runs    |
| `official`  | strict           | yes         | quarterly transparency post     |
| `audited`   | reserved         | not yet     | future revision (sprint 2 / 3)  |

`audited` is accepted by the JSON schema for forward compatibility but the CLI returns `Error: audited intent is not yet implemented` and exits with code 2.

## Granularity

- `--confidentiality internal` produces G1 entries per application: the per-anti-pattern breakdown (`anti_patterns: [...]`) is included.
- `--confidentiality public` produces G2 entries: the aggregate per service, plus a single `anti_patterns_detected_count`, but no per-pattern detail.

The validator refuses to publish a `confidentiality = public` disclosure that carries G1 entries.

## Inputs

The aggregator reads NDJSON files that the daemon archives one envelope per scoring window:

```json
{"ts":"2026-01-15T14:30:00Z","report":{ ...full Report... }}
```

Configure the daemon archive via:

```toml
[daemon.archive]
path = "/var/lib/perf-sentinel/reports.ndjson"
max_size_mb = 100
max_files = 12
```

When the active file exceeds `max_size_mb`, perf-sentinel renames it to `reports-<utc-timestamp>.ndjson` and starts a fresh file. Older rotated files beyond `max_files` are pruned by modification time.

Operators that already collect daemon stdout via a sidecar can pass the resulting file (or directory) to `--input` directly, as long as each line is one `{ts, report}` envelope.

## org-config TOML

The static organisation/methodology/scope fields live in a TOML file you check into your infrastructure repository alongside the rest of the perf-sentinel config. A complete example sits in `docs/examples/perf-sentinel-org.toml`. The same file is referenced by `[reporting] org_config_path` when the daemon is asked to validate publishable disclosures at startup.

## Example: internal draft (G1)

```bash
perf-sentinel disclose \
  --intent internal \
  --confidentiality internal \
  --period-type calendar-quarter \
  --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-03-31 \
  --input /var/lib/perf-sentinel/reports.ndjson \
  --output /tmp/perf-sentinel-report.json \
  --org-config /etc/perf-sentinel/org.toml
```

The output passes only the structural checks (no validator). `integrity.content_hash` is computed and stable but `integrity.binary_hash` is the SHA-256 of the locally running binary, not necessarily a published release.

## Example: official publication (G2)

```bash
perf-sentinel disclose \
  --intent official \
  --confidentiality public \
  --period-type calendar-quarter \
  --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-03-31 \
  --input /var/lib/perf-sentinel/reports.ndjson \
  --output /var/www/transparency/perf-sentinel-report.json \
  --org-config /etc/perf-sentinel/org.toml
```

The validator runs over the full document. If any required field is missing or out of range, the CLI prints every offending field and exits 2. Fix the org-config (or the underlying data) and re-run.

The recommended publication path is the root of your transparency domain:

```
https://transparency.example.fr/perf-sentinel-report.json
```

The schema URL inside `notes.reference_urls.schema` advertises which schema version a consumer should fetch to validate the file.

## Daemon-driven gating

When the daemon is configured with `[reporting] intent = "official"`, it refuses to start if the org-config TOML is missing or fails the static-field validator. The error message lists every missing or invalid field so an operator fixes them all in one pass.

```toml
[reporting]
intent = "official"
confidentiality_level = "public"
org_config_path = "/etc/perf-sentinel/org.toml"
disclose_output_path = "/var/lib/perf-sentinel/last-disclosure.json"
disclose_period = "calendar-quarter"
```

`intent = "internal"` (or omitting the section) leaves the daemon in monitoring mode without the publishable-disclosure gate.

## Verifying a published disclosure

A third party can verify a published file with three commands:

```bash
# 1. The schema id under notes.reference_urls.schema points to a JSON
#    Schema v2020-12 published in the perf-sentinel repository.
jq -r '.notes.reference_urls.schema' perf-sentinel-report.json

# 2. The content_hash is reproducible. The canonical bytes are produced
#    by perf-sentinel itself via `serde_json` shortest round-trip
#    number formatting plus a recursive BTreeMap key sort. A `jq`
#    pipeline cannot match those bytes byte-for-byte for arbitrary
#    f64 values (jq emits IEEE-754 repr, serde_json emits shortest
#    round-trip). The reproducible reference implementation is:
#       perf-sentinel verify-hash <path>
#    (sprint 2 deliverable, until then use the perf-sentinel binary
#    to recompute or accept the hash as-shipped).

# 3. The binary_hash matches the perf-sentinel release tag listed in
#    integrity.binary_verification_url. Download the release artifact,
#    SHA-256 it locally, compare.
jq -r '.integrity.binary_hash' perf-sentinel-report.json
```

## Common errors

- `Error: audited intent is not yet implemented`: switch `--intent` to `internal` or `official`.
- `no archived reports fell within the requested period`: the archive contains lines but none match the `--from`/`--to` window. Check timestamps, especially around DST and timezone boundaries (the aggregator filters on UTC dates).
- `Error: report validation failed` followed by a bullet list: every line names the offending field. Fix in the org-config TOML or in the source archive.
- `strict_attribution` enabled and a window with no offenders: drop the flag or fix the per-service instrumentation that's hiding the offenders.

## Scope and limitations

The disclosure is a directional estimate with a `2x` multiplicative uncertainty bracket. It is not regulatory-grade and not suitable for CSRD or GHG Protocol Scope 3 reporting. See `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` for the full calculation chain and the calibration sources that can tighten the bracket (Scaphandre RAPL, cloud SPECpower, Electricity Maps).
